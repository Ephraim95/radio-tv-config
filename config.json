  "privacyPolicyContent": "Adepa Radio ("we", "our", "us") respects and protects the privacy of all users who install and use our Android application. This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use the Adepa Radio app. By using the app, you agree to the terms described in this policy. We do not require users to register or provide personal details such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers. However, when users contact us via email or other means, we may collect and retain that contact information solely to respond to inquiries. The app may automatically collect basic usage data such as IP address, device model, operating system version, app version, and general interaction patterns, including crash logs, to improve performance and user experience. We do not track your exact location, but general region data may be inferred from your IP address to help with content distribution and analytics. The app may use third-party services such as Google Play Services, Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics, or streaming providers, which may collect data as governed by their own privacy policies. We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes. Information collected is used to provide streaming functionality, troubleshoot issues, and understand app usage for improvement. We may share anonymized usage data with trusted service providers under confidentiality agreements. We do not disclose user information unless required by law or in response to legal processes. Data collected is retained only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes stated in this policy, after which it is deleted or anonymized. We implement standard security practices to protect data, but no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. The app is not intended for use by children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect data from minors. If a parent or guardian believes that their child has provided us with personal information, they should contact us to have it removed. Depending on your location, you may have rights under data protection laws, such as access to your data, correction, deletion, or objection to processing. You can contact us at adeparadio@gmail.com to make such requests. The app may show third-party ads through platforms such as Google AdMob, which may use device identifiers or cookies to show relevant content. You can disable personalized ads in your deviceâ€™s Google ad settings. Adepa Radio may contain links to external platforms, such as social media, which are governed by their own privacy policies. We may update this policy occasionally and will update the effective date at the top. Continued use of the app after changes means you accept the revised policy. If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy or how your data is handled, please contact us via email at adeparadio@gmail.com.",
